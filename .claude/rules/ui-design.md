## UI Design Direction

- Praxis uses a dark theme: dark slate gradient backgrounds (#0f172a → #1e293b)
- Glassmorphic card style: semi-transparent backgrounds (rgba(255,255,255,0.04)), subtle borders (#1e293b)
- Hover: blue glow (#3b82f6 border, blue shadow, translateY lift)
- Typography: light text on dark (#f8fafc titles, #e2e8f0 body, #64748b secondary)
- Accent gradient: blue-to-purple (#3b82f6 → #8b5cf6)
- User strongly prefers modern, polished UI — not bare-bones functional
